## Project Milestone 3

Version History: 

- Released 2019/2/18

The subject of the project is a stand alone ordering system for a restaurant,
such as those seen locally as places like In and Out Deli, Panera, and Jimmy's
Pita and Poke.

Due Friday March 15, 8PM (group), 8:30 PM (individual)

In this milestone we are:

- Coming to consensus with our newly formed group members
- Stating the agreed-upon context of use of our stand alone ordering system
- Stating clearly what it means to place an order for lunch and prioritizing
  additional features
- Creating and demonstrating a paper prototype
- Explaining the rationale for your choice of design concept
- Individually stating our contributions and the contributions of our team
  members to this milestone.

The artifacts generated should be presented in a single HTML page as described
below. No style information should be in the HTML tags. Do not use
HTML tags like `<center>`, `<b>`, or `<i>` to alter visual appearance.
Programmatically added SVG elements may have style attributes.

See your group's thread on Piazza for the github submission link.
At the time of submission, it should contain one HTML file named `PM3.html`
and any other files needed by the assignment (CSS files, Javascript files,
image or media needed).

Use the following link to create your individual github repository for this
assignment:
[https://classroom.github.com/a/2ErVF1Hw](https://classroom.github.com/a/2ErVF1Hw).
At the time of submission it should contain a text file named
`PM3-evaluations.txt`.


### Content - Header information 

At the top of your report, state the names of all the team members as well as
your team name. You can name your team what you like as long as it is
professionally appropriate. 

#### Context of Use (10 pts)

Write clearly the context of use for your stand alone ordering system as in
PM2.

For example, as we discussed in class, some expect people walking up to be
seated later, some are for To-Go users only, and some are table-side. Some
accept credit only and some allow cash. Any of these is fine, but this should
be made clear.

In PM2, some of you discussed the type of restaurant you would support. Your
context of use should refine this in terms of what your expectations are
regarding the menu and what the user could do. It may help to be specific.
Instead of a general system for your type of restaurant, come up with a
concrete idea of what your restaurant is, what kind of food they serve, and
what's on their menu. You may want to constrain the menu at first but discuss
how it could become more complicated as the project allows. 

Write your context of use in prose (i.e., paragraphs) under a header "Context
of Use." 

#### Statement of Tasks (25 pts)

The header for this section should be "Statement of Tasks."

For this project, we are focusing on the main goal of a user ordering lunch.
As a group, construct a set of sub-tasks that are the bare minimum for
supporting this goal. Write this as a (potentially nested) ordered list under
a sub-header "Minimum Proposed Tasks." Underneath the list, write a paragraph
explaining your rationale for these minimum tasks. You may refer to PM1 and
other experience to support this rationale. 

The purpose of the Minimum Tasks is to initially constrain the focus of the
project. In that way, it acts like a project proposal. 

Create an ordered list of sub-tasks that are non-essential but you foresee
increasing the usability of your system. The list should be ordered by
importance. Write this as a (potentially nested) ordered list under a
sub-header "Extended Proposed Tasks." Underneath the list, write a paragraph
explaining your rationale for these tasks. You may refer to PM1 and other
experience to support this rationale.

The purpose of the Extended Tasks is to:

1. Anticipate potential issues that come up during evaluation.
2. Aid in thinking about the extensibility of your design.
3. Aid in planning should the design, implementation, and evaluation of your
   Minimum Tasks run smoothly enough to allow you to extend the project.

The main idea is to start small and focused so you can have a complete
interface prototype but allow room to grow should the initial concept be too
small. You may want to start with the assumption of a limited menu for the
minimum tasks, but propose how the menu could become more complicated and thus
how the tasks should grow to support that. 


#### Prototype Design (25 pts)

From your combined PM1 and PM2 submissions, as well as your stated context and
tasks above, select and elaborate on an group design. 

Include the design as a mockup/sketch (not photos of the paper prototype).
Beneath the image, write your explanation of the design concept as a
paragraph. 

Beneath the design concept paragraph, create a sub-header "Design Rationale."
Write your rationale for the design. Given the amount of background you now
have from the previous milestones, I expect this rationale to be thorough.

Beneath the "Design Rationale", create a sub-header called "Supporting
Artifacts". Each artifact (or set of artifacts if there are many
sketches/images of the same idea) should be in its own collapsible area,
following the accordion interaction design pattern. Do not include all of your
PM1s and PM2s, but you may include excerpts from each as referenced by your
design rationale. 

#### Paper Prototype (25 pts)

Create a paper prototype. Embed a movie showing the prototype through three
different “ordering lunch” scenarios. For example, one can show the scenario
of a user who is familiar with the interface and knows exactly what she wants
while another could show a user who has to do more searching.

Please include audio to describe the scenario OR include text underneath the
embedded movie explaining what is happening in each scenario. It might not be
otherwise understandable in the movie.

Remember that this paper prototype will be used for evaluation by people
outside this class in PM4. It should be nice enough that those participants
will understand what is going on during evaluation. 

The paper prototype should be under the header "Paper Prototype."


### Format (10 pts)

The only constraints on the format, other than what is described above are:

- The report should be reasonably readable. For example, black text on a black
  background is not reasonable. 
- The headers should be differentiable from the body text and spacing should
  be used to help readability.
- There should be some persistent way for us to navigate between sections.
- The title should have your group name.  
- The report content should be 640 pixels wide with a 12 point sans-serif
  font for the report text.


### Individual Evaluations (5 pts)

This content should be written by each individual after the project milestone is
submitted. Use the separate individual github classroom link.

At the top of your evaluation, estimate the distribution of work contributed
by yourself and your teammates. You will do this by starting with 20 units for
each members of your team (a total of 60 for a 3 person team, 80 for a 4
person team). You will then apportion the units to yourself and your team
members to indicate distribution. If everyone has 20 unit, that means equal
distribution.

We will assess the distributions listed as well as the contributions described
for balance and may apply a weighting/scaling factor to individual grades to
account for discrepancies. More work does not necessarily mean a higher
grade--taking over the project and influencing others to not participate is
discouraged.


Example:
```
Unit Distribution

Blinky: 17

Pinky: 21

Inky: 22

Clyde: 20

```

The second paragraph should describe what your contributions to the project
milestone were:

```
Individual Contributions -- FamilyName, GivenName

My contributions were...
```

Then, for each of your team members, write a section headed with their name
explaining what their contributions were and rating them on:

1. Quality of Work
2. Timeliness of Work Completion
3. Contributions to Group Discussion
4. Cooperative and Supportive Attitude

Ratings should be one of [Below Expectations, Good, Above and Beyond]. 

Beneath the ratings you may provide more detail explaining your ratings or any
other information we should know.


Example:
```
Peer Assessment -- FamilyName, GivenName

GivenName's contributions were... 

1. Quality of Work: Good

2. Timeliness of Work Completion: Below Expectations

3. Contributions to Group Discussion: Good

4. Cooperative and Supportive Attitude: Good

GivenName did a good job on the paper prototype but was two days later than we
planned so we had to scramble to make the movie.
```

### Distribution

All team members should participate in the discussion of the context of use,
tasks, and initial design.

The team should strive to apportion equitably. It is up to the team how this
can be done. 

It may help to appoint different people to draft each writing section and then
someone else to check/edit the writing for completeness. Similarly, one person
can be in charge of assembling the webpage and another in charge of checking
it for compliance. 

One person may be in charge of designing the three initial scenarios, perhaps
with storyboards or step-by-step procedures, while another is in charge of
crafting the paper prototype (but others may help). A third person can then
prepare those storyboard for the accordion section of the report. One to two
people can demonstrate the paper prototype while a third one films.
